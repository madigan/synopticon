# synopticon

`synopticon` is a personal knowledge management (PKM) program designed to help knowledge workers manage their knowledge in a chaotic world. It's the note-taking app that I wish I had had in school.

`synopticon` provides three core concepts to help you manage knowledge:

- **objects** represent the pieces of knowledge you want to keep track of. Examples include notes (in markdown), TODOs, and PDF files. Generally speaking, objects are persisted in Markdown so that you're not locked in to synopticon or another tool.
- **collections** represent groups of objects. These groupings can be static lists or dynamic queries. Static collections are stored locally as YAML files.
- **views** determine how to display objects and collections. A note might have a text editor view, be a node in a graph view, or be located on a canvas.
